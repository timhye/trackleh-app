# TrackLeh - Smart Expense Tracker

A modern expense tracking application designed to eliminate the manual entry overhead and forgetfulness that plague traditional expense trackers. Built for busy users who want proactive financial management without the hassle.

## üéØ Project Motivation

TrackLeh was created to solve common pain points with existing expense tracker apps:
- **Manual entry overhead** - Tedious data input that users often skip
- **Forgetfulness** - Leading to inconsistent and inaccurate tracking
- **Poor user experience** - Apps that feel like work rather than helpful tools

The app targets users who may be busy or "lazy" but want to proactively manage their finances with minimal effort.
